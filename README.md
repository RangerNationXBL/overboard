# overboard
I created this as a project to work on during my programming classes, it was very basic, just used the terminal to output the area of a triangle. Now its here on GitHub.

This is the start of my over the top calculating the area of a triangle. I am new to python and on my 3rd semester of CIS Programming. I don't know why I made this I just did.

The file in the repository is already functioning as a basic program. I plan on doing more over the top things to it.

The comments are the items I am trying to make work..
